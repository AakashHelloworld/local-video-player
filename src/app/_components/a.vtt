WEBVTT

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.979
so pretend you're this guy and you were

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.170
really productive earlier the month in

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.790
fact you are kind of killing it you're

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.500
reading lots of books hitting the gym

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.540
consistently and actually getting your

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.309
work in on time but then something

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.019
happened maybe you woke up on the wrong

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.980
side of the bed

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.289
maybe an invisible demon ghost violated

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.789
you in your sleep whatever the case may

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.220
be everything seems just a bit harder to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.680
do you're tired you've lost all the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.660
motivation you had to keep being awesome

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.430
and you can't even remember why you were

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.019
being productive in the first place and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.119
that mental clarity that you seem to be

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.520
the beneficiary of just yesterday seems

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.050
to have ran away in the night and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.149
unfortunately this lack of motivation

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.969
starts to seep into the other areas of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.160
your life the thought dawns on you to go

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.320
to the gym and you're too lazy to do it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.629
so you skip the gym that day one day

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.610
turns into two days two days turns into

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.530
a week you're also starting to buy more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.289
junk food watch more TV play more video

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.570
games and not only are you not doing the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.250
things you know you should be doing but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.260
you don't even want to you can't even

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.270
remember why you were being productive

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.100
in the first place why are we still here

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.319
for a lot of people these long periods

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.700
of success followed by long periods of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.260
self-destruction and failure seem to be

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.330
a common pattern and while this issue is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.700
a deep psychological issue that I'll

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.009
dive into in a later video I wanted to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.409
give you guys a more practical guide as

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.320
to how I get myself out of these type of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.869
pseudo depressive ruts and start being

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.820
productive again now before we dive into

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.710
these really powerful strategies I just

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.210
want to preface the video with a couple

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.970
things number one is that this video is

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.400
not meant to be a replacement for going

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.799
to therapy if you actually have clinical

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.900
depression I'm not a doctor I'm just a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.600
dude and I talk about what works for me

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.520
second of all even though this video is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.960
about how to get out of a rut

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.210
efficiently or quickly that's all

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.130
relative you're usually not going to get

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.740
out of a rut overnight okay so strategy

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.470
number one is to utilize the dosomething

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.990
principle this principle is the catalyst

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.850
for action if you don't have the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.829
motivation to do something you need

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.259
something that'll spark some sort of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.090
action something to get the momentum

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.530
going something to get the ball rolling

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.080
and to do something principle is a means

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.280
to take action

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.050
when you don't have the motivation to do

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.600
anything so most people think that in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.030
order to take action on anything you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.709
need to be motivated to do that and

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.900
motivation comes when you're inspired by

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.910
something so for instance say you're

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.590
browsing reddit or something and you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.590
come across a Matt D Avella video and by

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.390
the end he says something that strikes a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.520
chord with you and you're inspired to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.830
take action that inspiration served as

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.709
the adequate motivation to take action

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.690
on your goals but the dosomething

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.180
principle dictates that inspiration

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.940
motivation action is not a linear

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.580
sequence it's an endless loop and you

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.739
can start wherever you want to start so

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.050
it's far more efficient to start with

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.600
action and let that action become the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.910
inspiration and the motivation necessary

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.440
to take further action so you may be

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.209
thinking thanks genius if I'm

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.430
unmotivated to do something then I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.019
should just do something that's really

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.000
helpful but you actually take action

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.400
without motivation all the time do you

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.319
need some sort of huge inspirational

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.780
epiphany to take a shower no it's just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.819
something you do these monotonous

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.040
actions are the very actions you should

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.470
be using as momentum to take further

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.380
action if you're just sitting there

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.660
waiting for inspiration to strike you go

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.280
brush your teeth brushing your teeth is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.530
a little constructive action that will

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.390
give you momentum into taking further

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.370
action if you have to write a giant

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.380
essay don't think to yourself oh I have

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.420
to go and write my giant four thousand

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.940
word essay just say I'm gonna open up

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.220
the word doc write whatever comes to my

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.930
mind for one minute and that's it that's

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.489
all I have to do but once you start

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.500
writing you will tend to want to write

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.970
more because you've convinced yourself

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.579
to get there that is in essence to do

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.470
something principled now strategy number

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.480
two seems counterintuitive to what I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.700
just said and that is to reward yourself

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.070
for small wins now if you follow this

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.290
channel at all I am NOT a pat yourself

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.480
on the back and everyone gets an award

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.400
kind of guy so if you're in the same

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.140
boat you might cringe at the thought of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.600
rewarding yourself for taking a shower

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.220
or something like that because you know

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.470
you're capable of so much more but the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.510
need to reward yourself for small wins

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.399
especially if you're in a vulnerable

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.250
situation is a psychological necessity

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.349
and it has everything to do with the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.350
fact that you have basically two

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.970
a brain and I'm not talking about right

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.860
and left I'm talking more about the more

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.660
primal part of your brain which is

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.370
closer to the stem which is responsible

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.220
for motivation and emotion and stuff

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.260
like that and you're more logical

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.750
abstract moralistic part of your brain

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.610
which is present more in the prefrontal

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.340
cortex so if your prefrontal cortex

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.070
knows to use the do something principle

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.350
in order to convince but here a primal

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.850
side of your brain to take action on

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.560
something it's important that you're not

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.840
to iron-fisted with this because it's a

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.880
negotiation with yourself don't be a

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.070
slave driver to the primal side of your

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.870
brain or your primal side of your brain

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.060
won't feel listened to it'll lash out

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.500
and it won't want to do anything that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.420
your logical side of your brain wants it

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.980
to do so you almost need to use your

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.800
higher judgment to provide compassionate

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.230
guidance to the primal part of your

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.780
brain and very gradually win it over if

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.430
you're too lazy to pretty much do

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.080
anything other than sit around all day

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.150
and you use the do something principle

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.740
to convince your primal side of your

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.990
brain to brush your teeth take a shower

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.270
get some nice clothes on and clean your

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.590
kitchen and you start to get really

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.170
tired and agitated after this take a

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.710
break

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.080
it may sound suspect and your logical

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.610
side of your brain knows that you should

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.620
be doing a lot more than that just take

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.120
it easy reward yourself for doing

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.340
something constructive for once after

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.800
days of binging dopamine and just relax

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.060
and have a good time so you might be

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.950
thinking how the heck am I supposed to

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.810
get out of a rut if I don't ride this

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.670
momentum out into the sunset

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.320
that's what tip number three is all

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.990
about so strategy number three is all

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.510
about progressive overload it's very

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.520
similar to the philosophy of lifting

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.930
weights and getting stronger

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.210
instead of yo-yoing between taking crazy

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.160
amounts of action and then your primal

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.050
brain lashing out and going into long

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.940
periods of self-destruction you should

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.430
be massaging yourself into organically

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.040
growing a lifestyle that you gradually

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.480
get used to that's more and more

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.010
productive and you do more and more

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.200
every day while rewarding yourself for

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.630
the small wins and comparing yourself to

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.820
who you were yesterday rather than who

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.010
someone else is today so for instance if

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.170
you develop a game plan over the course

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.790
of seven days to get out of a riot

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.470
that's a lot more realistic than just

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.150
trying to be productive all of a sudden

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.420
so say day one you

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.430
can't really do much other than go on

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.320
the internet for long periods of time on

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.300
this day if you convince yourself to

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.800
take pretty much any sort of

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.480
constructive action that should be

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.460
sufficient for the day day one should

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.380
just be about gradually taking a little

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.180
bit more action and being happy with

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.040
that and the next day remind yourself

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.300
that that wasn't so bad and actually

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.310
felt pretty good to take action and try

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.990
to do a little bit more and if you do

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.270
this day after day then gradually and

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.220
organically both sides of your brain

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.110
will be in agreeance and you'll very

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.450
comfortably start to rise from the ashes

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.150
like a phoenix and become the person

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.250
that you were earlier in that month I

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.930
can't stress how important this is

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.870
managing expectations being patient with

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.370
yourself and letting your higher

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.470
faculties be very communicative with the

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.240
more primal and emotional sides of your
